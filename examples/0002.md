SELECT COUNT(*),MAX(SALARY),MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE;
SELECT COUNT(*),MAX(SALARY),MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE DEPT='ABC';
SELECT COUNT(ID),COUNT(BONUS) FROM EMPLOYEE;
SELECT MAX(SALARY),MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE;
SELECT COUNT(ID),COUNT(BONUS) FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

```sql
SELECT ID,ENAME,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE ORDER BY SALARY ASC;
SELECT ID,ENAME,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE ORDER BY SALARY DESC;
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE ORDER BY DEPT, DESIGNATION;

```
